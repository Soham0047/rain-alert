# rain-alert
A Python-based weather alert app that uses OpenWeatherMap API to check for rain and Twilio API to send notifications via WhatsApp. The app checks weather conditions for the next few hours and alerts users if rain is expected. Ideal for learning about API integration, HTTP requests, and automated messaging services.
